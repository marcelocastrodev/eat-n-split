# Eat-N-Split

This is a fairly basic React project, created to give me a better understanding on how components communicate with each other using props to pass data (as parameters and children) and event delegation.

## Install dependencies

Once the project is cloned/downloaded, execute: `npm install` to install all required dependency by the project.

## Start the project

Finally run, `npm start` to run the compile and prepare the webpack. A full explanation of the process can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-react-app-npm-scripts-explained/)

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
